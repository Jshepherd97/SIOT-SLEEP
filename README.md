This project investigated the relationship between indoor environmental quality data, specifically temperature, and sleep activity. The output of this project was an IOT system that notifies users of their bedroom temperature 30 minutes before bedtime and suggests actions they can take to favourably alter it for better sleep. The web-app for this system can be viewed at https://www.mysleepclimate.com/ and the project report is stored in this repository 

All graphs and data analysis shown in this project can be recreated by downloading the repository and running the 'Analysis.m' file in Matlab.
